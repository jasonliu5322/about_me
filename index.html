                <p>An aircraft propeller is an aerodynamic device which 
                    converts rotational energy into propulsive force creating 
                    thrust which is approximately perpendicular to its plane 
                    of rotation.</p>

                <p>Stacy is my youngest niece who was born at June 15th, 2018. She is a very
                    smart and cute little girl. Her elder sister, Jelissa who is my niece I like the 
                    best. She is a easy-going person and good at drawing. </p>
